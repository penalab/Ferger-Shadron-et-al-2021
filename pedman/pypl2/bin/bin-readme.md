Because it is not clear if the re-distribution of the Plexon DLL files is allowed,
they are currently not included in this repository.

You can, however, find them as part of the "OmniPlex and MAP Offline SDK Bundle"
on the Plexon Inc website: www.plexon.com

A free download was available at the time of this writing at:  
https://plexon.com/software-downloads/#software-downloads-SDKs

Under "OmniPlex and MAP Offline (For reading previously recorded data files)"
you can download the "OmniPlex and MAP Offline SDK Bundle".

The required files are in the bundle, at:

* Plexon Offline SDK
* Python PL2 Offline Files SDK.zip
* PyPL2
* bin

Just paste the two .dll files inside the directory of this readme file.
